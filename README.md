# The_Browser_Snake
This is a snake game written in HTML JavaScript and a tad of CSS.

# The gameplay is simple:
-Use the arrow keys to move the snake.  
-Eat the apples to advance in score and difficulty/speed.  
-Every time you eat an apple you get one point and your base speed, as well as the snake's size, will be increased.  
-Every 9 red apples a green apple appears. This apple will double your speed until you get the very next red apple.  
-When you hit the snake's body the game is over and your highest score is saved for one year (or until you beat it before that) with the help of cookies.  

# Buttons:
   ArrowUp - Up  
 ArrowDown - Down  
 ArrowLeft - Left  
ArrowRight - Right  
      KeyQ - Quit the game without saving your current score  
      KeyP - Pause the game. Press again to Resume  
     Space - Extra Acceleration (The snake continues to accelerate as you keep playing)  
      KeyE - Reduce Extra Acceleration (Can only reduce the Extra Acceleration. Not the always accelerating Base Speed)
